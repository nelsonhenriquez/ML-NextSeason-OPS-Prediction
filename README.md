## Features
- Data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis with Pandas and Seaborn
- Predictive models including Linear Regression and Random Forest
- Model evaluation with R², MAE, and RMSE metrics
- Visualizations to identify trends and key predictors

## Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, Seaborn, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo  
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
